# simple_sync

Super simple two way sync. 
The aim for this is when you work on something in both ends, and you
want to easily change sync direction.
Run this on the "active" side, when you start working on the other end
just fire this up on that node, first it terminates this on the other
end, then it will continously sync content there, until you stop it
or it gets terminated by the other end starting to source the syncing.
